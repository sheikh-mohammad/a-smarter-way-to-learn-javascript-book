My name is Mark. My nationality is U.S. Now that you've memorized my name and nationality, I won't have to repeat them, literally, again. If I say to you, \"You probably know other people who have my name,\" you'll know I'm referring to \"Mark.\" If I ask you whether my nationality is the same as yours, I won't have to ask, \"Is your nationality the same as U.S.?\" I'll ask, \"Is your nationality the same as my nationality?\" You'll remember that when I say \"my nationality,\" I'm referring to \"U.S.\", and you'll compare your nationality to \"U.S.\", even though I haven't said \"U.S.\" explicitly. In these examples, the terms \"my name\" and \"my nationality\" work the same way JavaScript variables do. My name is a term that refers to a particular value, \"Mark.\" In the same way, a variable is a word that refers to a particular value. A variable is created when you write var (for variable) followed by the name that you choose to give it. It takes on a particular value when you assign the value to it. This is a JavaScript statement that creates the variable name and assigns the value \"Mark\" to it. var name = \"Mark\"; Now the variable name refers to the text string \"Mark\". Note that it was my choice to call it name . I could have called it myName , xyz , lol , or something else. It's up to me how to name my variables, within limits. With the string \"Mark\" assigned to the variable name , my JavaScript code doesn't have to specify \"Mark\" again. Whenever JavaScript encounters name , JavaScript knows that it's a variable that refers to \"Mark\". For example, if you ask JavaScript to print name , it remembers the value that name refers to, and prints... Mark The value that a variable refers to can change. Let's get back to the original examples, the facts I asked you to memorize. These facts can change, and if they do, the terms my name and my nationality will refer to new values. I could go to court and change my name to Ace. Then my name is no longer Mark. If I want you to address me correctly, I'll have to tell you that my name is now Ace. After I tell you that, you'll know that my name doesn't refer to the value it used to refer to (Mark), but refers to a new value (Ace). If I transfer my nationality to U.K., my nationality is no longer U.S. It's U.K. If I want you to know my nationality, I'll have to tell you that it is now U.K. After I tell you that you'll know that my nationality doesn't refer to the original value, \"U.S.\", but now refers to a new value. JavaScript variables can also change. If I code... var name = \"Mark\"; name refers to \"Mark\". Then I come along and code the line... name = \"Ace\"; Before I coded the new line, if I asked JavaScript to print name , it printed... Mark But that was then. Now if I ask JavaScript to print name , it prints... Ace A variable can have any number of values, but only one at a time. You may be wondering why, in the statement above that assigns \"Ace\" to name , the keyword var is missing. It's because the variable was declared earlier, in the original statement that assigned \"Mark\" to it. Remember, var is the keyword that creates a variable the keyword that declares it. Once a variable has been declared, you don't have to declare it again. You can just assign the new value to it. You can declare a variable in one statement, leaving it undefined. Then you can assign a value to it in a later statement, without declaring it again. var nationality; nationality = \"U.S.\"; In the example above, the assignment statement follows the declaration statement immediately. But any amount of code can separate the two statements, as long as the declaration statement comes first. In fact, there's no law that says you have to ever define a variable that you've declared. JavaScript variable names have no inherent meaning to JavaScript. In English, words have meaning. You can't use just any word to communicate. I can say, \"My name is Mark,\" but, if I want to be understood, I can't say, \"My floogle is Mark.\" That's nonsense. But with variables, JavaScript is blind to semantics. You can use just any word (as long as it doesn't break the rules of variable-naming). From JavaScript's point of view... var floogle = \"Mark\"; ...is just as good as... var name = \"Mark\"; If you write... var floogle = \"Mark\"; ...then ask JavaScript to print floogle, JavaScript prints... Mark Within limits, you can name variables anything you want, and JavaScript won't care. var lessonAuthor = \"Mark\"; var guyWhoKeepsSayingHisOwnName = \"Mark\"; var x = \"Mark\"; JavaScript's blindness to meaning notwithstanding, when it comes to variable names, you'll want to give your variables meaningful names, because it'll help you and other coders understand your code. Again, the syntactic difference between variables and text strings is that variables are never enclosed in quotes, and text strings are always enclosed in quotes. It's always... var lastName = \"Smith\"; var cityOfOrigin = \"New Orleans\"; var aussieGreeting = \"g'Day\"; If it's an alphabet letter or word, and it isn't enclosed in quotes, and it isn't a keyword that has special meaning for JavaScript, like alert , it's a variable. If it's some characters enclosed in quotes, it's a text string. If you haven't noticed, let me point out the spaces between the variable and the equal sign, and between the equal sign and the value. var nickname = \"Bub\"; These spaces are a style choice rather than a legal requirement. But I'll ask you to include them in your code throughout the practice exercises. In the last chapter you learned to write... alert(\"Thanks for your input!\"); When the code executes, a message box displays saying \"Thanks for your input!\" But what if you wrote these two statements instead: var thanx = \"Thanks for your input!\" alert(thanx); Instead of placing a text string inside the parentheses of the alert statement, the code above assigns the text string to a variable. Then it places the variable, not the string, inside the parentheses. Because JavaScript always substitutes the value for the variable, JavaScript displays\u2014not the variable name thanx but the text to which it refers, \"Thanks for your input!\" That same alert, \"Thanks for your input!\" displays.","title":"Chapter 02: Variables for Strings"},{"location":"chapter_02_variables_for_strings/#chapter-02-variables-for-strings","text":"Please memorize the following facts.

You can use this variable in math calculations. If you ask JavaScript to add 25 to weight ... weight + 25 ...JavaScript, remembering that weight refers to 150, will come up with the sum 175. Unlike a string, a number is not enclosed in quotes. That's how JavaScript knows it's a number that it can do math on and not a text string, like a ZIP code, that it handles as text. But then, since it's not enclosed in quotes, how does JavaScript know it's not a variable? Well, because a number, or any combination of characters starting with a number, can't be used as a variable name. If it's a number, JavaScript rejects it as a variable. So it must be a number. If you enclose a number in quotation marks, it's a string. JavaScript can't do addition on it. It can do addition only on numbers not enclosed in quotes. Now look at this code. var originalNum = 23; var newNum = originalNum + 7; In the second statement in the code above, JavaScript substitutes the number 23 when it encounters the variable originalNum . It adds 7 to 23. And it assigns the result, 30, to the variable newNum . JavaScript can also handle an expression made up of nothing but variables.

I'll tell you about this in a subsequent chapter. For now, know that a number enclosed by quotation marks is not a number, but a string, and JavaScript can't do addition on it.

Here are the rest of the rules: A variable name can't contain any spaces. A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.

As usual, you can mix variables and numbers. var num = 10; var popularNumber = num + 200; You can also use nothing but variables. var num = 10; var anotherNum = 1; var popularNumber = num + anotherNum; The arithmetic operators I've been using, +, -, *, and /, are undoubtedly familiar to you. This one may not be: var whatsLeftOver = 10 % 3; % is the modulus operator. It doesn't give you the result of dividing one number by another. It gives you the remainder when the division is executed. If one number divides evenly into another, the modulus operation returns 0. In the following statement, 0 is assigned to the variable. var whatsLeftOver = 9 % 3;","title":"Chapter 05: Math expressions: Familiar operators"},{"location":"chapter_06_math_expressions_unfamiliar_operators/","text":"Chapter 06: Math expressions: Unfamiliar operators There are several specialized math expressions you need to know.

But the result may surprise you. var num = 1; var newNum = num++; In the example above, the original value of num is assigned to newNum , and num is incremented afterward.
