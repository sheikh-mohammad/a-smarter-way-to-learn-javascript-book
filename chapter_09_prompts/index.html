    <h1 id="chapter-09-prompts">Chapter 09: Prompts</h1>
<p>A prompt box asks the user for some information and provides a response field for her
answer.</p>
<p>This code asks the user the question "Your species?" and provides a default answer in the
response field, "human". She can change the response. Whether she leaves the default response
as-is or changes it to something else, her response is assigned to the variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var spec = prompt(&quot;Your species?&quot;, &quot;human&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Prompt code is like alert code, with two differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. That means you need to start
by declaring a variable, followed by an equal sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a prompt, you can specify a second string. This is the default response that appears in
the field when the prompt displays. If the user leaves the default response as-is and just
clicks <strong>OK</strong>, the default response is assigned to the variable. It's up to you whether you
include a default response.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you might expect, you can assign the strings to variables, then specify the variables
instead of strings inside the parentheses.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var question = &quot;Your species?&quot;;
var defaultAnswer = &quot;human&quot;;
var spec = prompt(question, defaultAnswer);
</code></pre>
<p>The user's response is a text string. Even if the response is a number, it comes back as a
string. For example, consider this code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var numberOfCats = prompt(&quot;How many cats?&quot;);
var tooManyCats = numberOfCats + 1;
</code></pre>
<p>Since you're asking for a number, and the user is presumably entering one, you might
expect the math in the second statement to work. For example, if the user enters 3, the variable <code>tooManyCats</code> should have a value of 4, you might think. But no such luck. All responses to prompts come back as strings. When the string, "3", is linked with a plus to the number, 1, JavaScript converts the 1 to a string and concatenates. So the value of <code>tooManyCats</code> winds up being not 4 but "31". You'll learn how to solve this problem in a subsequent chapter.</p>
<p>If the user enters nothing and clicks <strong>OK</strong>, the variable is assigned an empty string: "". </p>
<p>If the user clicks <strong>Cancel</strong>, the variable is assigned a special value, <strong>null</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="coding-alternatives-to-be-aware-of"><strong><em>CODING ALTERNATIVES TO BE AWARE OF</em></strong></h2>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some coders write <code>window.prompt</code> instead of, simply, <code>prompt</code>. This is a highly formal
but perfectly correct way to write it. Most coders prefer the short form. We'll stick to the
short form in this training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the example above, some coders would use single rather than double quotation marks.
This is legal, as long as it's a matching pair. But in a case like this, I'll ask you to use
double quotation marks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
