    <h1 id="chapter-03-variables-for-numbers">Chapter 03: Variables for Numbers</h1>
<p>A string isn't the only thing you can assign to a variable. You can also assign a number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var weight = 150;
</code></pre>
<p>Having coded the statement above, whenever you write <code>weight</code> in your code, JavaScript
knows you mean 150. You can use this variable in math calculations.</p>
<p>If you ask JavaScript to add 25 to <code>weight</code>...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">weight + 25
</code></pre>
<p>...JavaScript, remembering that <code>weight</code> refers to 150, will come up with the sum 175.
Unlike a string, a number is not enclosed in quotes. That's how JavaScript knows it's a
number that it can do math on and not a text string, like a ZIP code, that it handles as text.
But then, since it's not enclosed in quotes, how does JavaScript know it's not a variable?
Well, because a number, or any combination of characters starting with a number, can't be used
as a variable name. If it's a number, JavaScript rejects it as a variable. So it must be a number.</p>
<p>If you enclose a number in quotation marks, it's a string. JavaScript can't do addition on it.</p>
<p>It can do addition only on numbers not enclosed in quotes.</p>
<p>Now look at this code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var originalNum = 23;
var newNum = originalNum + 7;
</code></pre>
<p>In the second statement in the code above, JavaScript substitutes the number 23 when it
encounters the variable <code>originalNum</code>. It adds 7 to 23. And it assigns the result, 30, to the
variable <code>newNum</code>.</p>
<p>JavaScript can also handle an expression made up of nothing but variables. For
example...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var originalNum = 23;
var numToBeAdded = 7;
var newNum = originalNum + numToBeAdded;
</code></pre>
<p>A variable can be used in calculating its own new value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var originalNum = 90;
originalNum = originalNum + 10;
</code></pre>
<p>If you enclose a number in quotation marks and add 7...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var originalNum = &quot;23&quot;;
var newNum = originalNum + 7;
</code></pre>
<p>...it won't work, because JavaScript can't sum a string and a number. JavaScript interprets
"23" as a word, not a number. In the second statement, it doesn't add 23 + 7 to total 30. It does something that might surprise you. I'll tell you about this in a subsequent chapter. For now, know that a number enclosed by quotation marks is not a number, but a string, and JavaScript can't do addition on it.</p>
<p>Note that any particular variable name can be the name of a number variable or string
variable. From JavaScript's point of view, there's nothing in a name that denotes one kind of
variable or another. In fact, a variable can start out as one type of variable, then become
another type of variable.</p>
<p>Did you notice what's new in...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var originalNumber = 23;
var newNumber = originalNumber + 7;
</code></pre>
<p>The statement assigns to the variable <code>newNumber</code> the result of a mathematical operation.
The result of this operation, of course, is a number value.</p>
<p>The example mixes a variable and a literal number in a math expression. But you could
also use nothing but numbers or nothing but variables. It's all the same to JavaScript.</p>
<p>I've told you that you can't begin a variable name with a number. The statement...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var 1stPresident = &quot;Washington&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>...is illegal, thanks to that initial "1" in the variable name.</p>
<p>But you can include numbers in variable names, as long as none of them come first. The
statement...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var prezWhoCame1st = &quot;Washington&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>...is legal.</p>
<p>Conveniently, if you specify a number instead of a string as an alert message...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">alert(144);
</code></pre>
<p>...or if you specify a variable that represents a number as an alert message...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var caseQty = 144;
alert(caseQty);
</code></pre>
<p>...JavaScript automatically converts it to a string and displays it.</p>
