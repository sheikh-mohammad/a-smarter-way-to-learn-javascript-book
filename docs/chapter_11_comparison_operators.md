# Chapter 10: Comparison operators

Let's talk a little more about `===`. It's a type of comparison operator, specifically an
*equality operator*. As you learned in the last chapter, you use it to *compare* two things to see if they're *equal*.

You can use the equality operator to compare a variable with a string, a variable with a
number, a variable with a math expression, or a variable with a variable. And you can use it to
compare various combinations. All of the following are legal first lines in *if* statements:

```javascript
if (fullName === "Mark" + " " + "Myers") {
if (fullName === firstName + " " + "Myers") {
if (fullName === firstName + " " + "Myers") {
if (fullName === "firstName + " " + lastName) {
if (totalCost === 81.50 + 135) {
if (totalCost === materialsCost + 135) {
if (totalCost === materialsCost + laborCost) {
if (x + y === a - b) {
```

When you're comparing strings, the equality operator is case-sensitive. "Rose" does not
equal "rose."

Another comparison operator, `!==`, is the opposite of `===`. It means is *not equal* to.

```javascript
if (yourTicketNumber !== 487208) {
    alert("Better luck next time.");
}
```

Like `===`, the not-equal operator can be used to compare numbers, strings, variables, math
expressions, and combinations.

Like `===`, string comparisons using the not-equal operator are case-sensitive. It's true that "Rose" `!==` "rose".

Here are 4 more comparison operators, usually used to compare numbers.

`>` is greater than

`<` is less than

`>=` is greater than or equal to

`<=` is less than or equal to

In the examples below, all the conditions are true.

```javascript
if (1 > 0) {
if (0 < 1) {
if (1 >= 0) {
if (1 >= 1) {
if (0 <= 1) {
if (1 <= 1) {
```

> ## CODING ALTERNATIVES TO BE AWARE OF

- Just as the double equal sign can usually be used instead of the triple equal sign, `!=` can usually be used instead of `!==`. In the exercises, I'll ask you to stick to `!==`.
